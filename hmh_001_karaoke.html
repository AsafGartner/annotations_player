    TODO:
    * Detect if the tab is visible/active:
        - Don't run the loop if the user can't see anything.
        - Restart the loop and rerender the current state when the user comes back.
    * Only run the update loop when we have something to do (playing or animating).
    * Consider unifying the marker click handler.
    * Consider manually blending the colors for the sub-pixel region of the completed marker. It looks like using opacity isn't perfect.
